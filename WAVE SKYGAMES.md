#games
  we have a few different games, skygen, skyblock, oneblock, floating chunk SMP
    *how to play
      -skygen:
         when you spawn you will see a few different kinds of ores and other blocks.
         once mined, these ores regenerate. you will find crafting tables, furnaces, etc.
         in one corner of the gen. after that it is pretty self explanatory.
      -skyblock:
         assuming you were the first to get onto the skyblock, you would find a chest, cobblestone generator, and a tree.
         you play pretty much exactly as normal survival except that you are on a small grass island over the never-ending void.
      -oneblock:
         this is just like skyblock, except that you only have one random regenerating block.
      -floating chunk smp:
         on this one, you spawn on a 64x64 area just like a normal survival world, this area resets each week.
         meaning that nothing you do here really matters that much.
